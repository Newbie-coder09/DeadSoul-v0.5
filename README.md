# DeadSoul-v0.5
This is a visual novel created by Ayush for someone special.

This visual novel is based on a finctional story and the characters are created in order to match the story. The sprites(characters) used in this game are taken from online sources and none of them belongs to me.

Context of the story:
The main character Ayush has a crush and her name is Priya. She's his junior in his college. He wants to make her his friend and the story continues from one fine morning.

The game's story is written inside script.rpy file and is in RenPy language. RenPy is a modified version of python and is used to create visual novels like this one.
The code is self explainatory and I've uploaded everything that are used in the game, images, music, video, etc.
